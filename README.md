RC Shell
===

A minimal UNIX shell.


Note: This is a work in progress

I am explaining this project as I progress on my blog:
* [Part I](https://indradhanush.github.io/blog/writing-a-unix-shell-part-1/)
deals with understanding `fork`.
* [Part II](https://indradhanush.github.io/blog/writing-a-unix-shell-part-2/)
explains how to execute commands like `ls` and `pwd`.
